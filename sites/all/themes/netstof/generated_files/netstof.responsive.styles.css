/*
 * responsive.custom.css is for custom media queries that are not set via the
 * theme settings, such as cascading media queries.
 *
 * By default all the other responsive stylesheets used in Adaptivetheme use a
 * "stacking method", however cascading media queries use a waterfall method so
 * you can leverage the cascade and inheritance for all browsers that support
 * media queries, regardless of screen size.
 *
 * @SEE http://zomigi.com/blog/essential-considerations-for-crafting-quality-media-queries/#mq-overlap-stack
 *
 * NOTE: this file loads by default, to disable got to your theme settings and
 * look under the "CSS" settings tab.
